*Black Friday Sales Prediction Analysis - Regression*
## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting sales for a retail store during the Black Friday event using regression analysis. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide insights into customer purchasing behavior and predict the purchase amount

**Dataset Information :** This dataset comprises of sales transactions captured at a retail store. The dataset has 550,069 rows and 12 columns.
The dataset contains details such as customer demographics, product categories and purchase amounts.

**Key Findings**

In our analysis of the Black Friday sales data, we observed several interesting trends and insights:

Demographic Features: Variables such as age, occupation, and gender were found to have a relatively minor impact on the purchase amount. Despite initial assumptions, these demographic factors did not significantly influence the spending behavior of customers.

Product Categories: One of the most significant findings was the relationship between product categories and purchase amounts. Specifically, products in Product Category 1 exhibited a strong correlation with higher purchase amounts compared to other categories. This indicates that the type of product being purchased plays a crucial role in determining the total spending during Black Friday.

These insights can help retailers focus their marketing and sales strategies more effectively, emphasizing popular product categories to maximize sales.
